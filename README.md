This is an employee data tracker. We can use it to add employees, departments, roles, as well as view each employee, department and role. We can also use this application to update an employee's role within our fine company.

To get started, make sure you have all of the packages required to run this application. Open your terminal on the package.json file and run npm i to make sure you have the packages installed.

With the packages installed, you may now use the application!

Run node server.js. You may use the up and down arrows to navigate the main menu. When you reach your desired field, simply press enter/return. From there, a series of prompts will guide you through what you wish to do.
